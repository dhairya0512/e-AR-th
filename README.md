# Earth in Augmented Reality



## Description

The mobile application developed in Unity 3D using AR Foundation package is an innovative educational tool designed to enhance students' understanding of planet Earth. The app allows students to explore a 3D model of Earth in augmented reality, providing an immersive and interactive learning experience.

Upon launching the app, students are prompted to scan their surroundings with their mobile device's camera, which will activate the AR features of the app. Once the AR environment is detected, a 3D model of Earth will be displayed on the screen, which students can rotate, zoom in, and out of, and explore in detail.

The 3D model of Earth is designed to be highly detailed and accurate, featuring realistic textures and topographical data, providing students with a realistic representation of the planet's surface. Additionally, the app includes interactive features, such as labels and pop-ups, that provide information about various features of Earth, such as the continents, oceans, and major landmarks.

The app is designed to be used as a supplemental educational tool in classrooms or for self-directed learning. It provides a fun and engaging way for students to learn about Earth's geography, geology, and ecosystems. With this app, students can gain a deeper understanding of our planet and its place in the universe, making it a valuable addition to any educational program.
